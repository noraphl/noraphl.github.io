Here I am at last. The proverbial white page lies ahead. But I'm currently usign night-mode, so I guess it's more accurate to say *"black page"*. 

I kinda don't know what to say now beyond I'm terribly exited and scared at the same time. Having potentially millions of people reading what I type alone in my room can be a terrifying thought. However, thank you for being here. 

I'll start by saying that this is a very simple site which has taken me more time than what I'd like to admit. It's hosted in Github and it's made using a nice Jekyll theme, [Minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), with which I managed to build on top of the [starter](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter) in just a few hours. Still took me days to finish the contents and give it a nicer look, did you notice the [Home page]() already? Sorry, I also took that style from a [faboulus artist](https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/css-text-gradient/) and just tweaked the colors a bit. Oh, I feel the shame already. Don't people always say to stand in the shoulders of giants or something? Well, I credited the original authors and now you can biuld your own thing, or maybe you can do much better, like [this guy](https://mademistakes.com/) who is in fact the creator of Minimal Mistakes. I wish I made such a cool-looking site like his. Thank you Michael for running so I could do baby-steps on building my personal website ðŸ‘¶. 

If you read the [About]() page, you'd probably know you can find both my blog and my personal/profesional info on this site. The contents are to be continued as I keep updating my projects and posts. 

So fast I've run out of thing to type, so keep on the look for the next one ðŸ˜œ.
